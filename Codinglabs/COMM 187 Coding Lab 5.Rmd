# **Introduction and Announcements**

Today we will be learning some more advanced data visualization! Since there is so many options for how to visualize data in R, we are going to be doing something a little bit different today. Instead of following a set tutorial, you are going to spend around 30-40 minutes looking through r-graph-gallery.com, and trying to replicate one of their example visualizations.

Next, you will spend the rest of class trying to create a cool visualization from your final project data.

But first, let's look at some examples of excellent data visualization in R.
